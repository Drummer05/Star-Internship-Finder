# Star Internship Finder Project Overview

**Business Scenario:** Star, a local startup, aims to help college students discover internships by creating a database management system. Currently, they manually track internship opportunities, which is inefficient and doesn't scale. The goal is to develop a system that matches students with internships based on criteria like location, major, interest, and skills.

**System Objectives:**
- Improve the efficiency of internship discovery for students.
- Enhance the process for companies to post and manage internship opportunities.
- Create a scalable solution to replace the pen-and-paper tracking method.

**Data Fields:**
- Company information: name, location, industry, salary, etc.
- Internship details: position, release date, due date, duration, link, etc.
- Student information: contact details, applied internships, unique identifier.
- Location data: unique location identifier.
- Requirements: unique requirement identifier.
- Position: unique position identifier.
